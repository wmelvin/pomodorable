## Initial Setup

Use Hatch to create project scaffold.

``` bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/Pomodorable
cd ~/Projects/Pomodorable
hatch new pomodorable
```

Decided to change the name of the project root directory to `pomodorable-project`.

``` bash
mv pomodorable pomodorable-project
cd ~/Projects/Pomodorable/pomodorable-project
```

Created a git repository.

Edited some of the hatch boilerplate in the generated files prior to initial commit.

``` bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
